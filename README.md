# TensorFlow-Speech-Recognition-Challenge
Tensorflow Speech Recognition Challenge was a Kaggle competition organised by Google Brain to use the Speech Commands Dataset to build an algorithm that understands simple spoken commands. https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge

I have built 2 models one using CONV1D and compared the output to another model using CONV2D.
But wait how did I use CONV2D on voice? 
I have transformed the audios to spectrograms 'images' and then build a CONV2D model and compared the outputs.
